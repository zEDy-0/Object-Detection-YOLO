YOLO Object Detection using OpenCV

Introduction

Object detection refers to a computer system's capacity to identify things inside an image or video, and YOLO is one of the most advanced and efficient algorithms utilised for this task. The YOLO algorithm breaks a picture into cells and estimates how likely each cell is to contain an object. To create predictions, the system uses a deep neural network to extract features from the image, which are then combined with information about the grid cells. One of YOLO's key benefits is its quickness. YOLO is significantly quicker than other object detection techniques that need repeated passes over a picture. This is critical for real-time applications such as self-driving cars and video monitoring.Another benefit of YOLO is its precision. The algorithm detects objects of various sizes and shapes with great accuracy, making it useful for a variety of applications. It is also resistant to occlusion and partial occlusion, so it can identify things that are partially concealed. YOLO is trained on a huge dataset of photos that have been tagged with data about the things they include. This enables the algorithm to learn to detect various objects and their attributes, such as form, size, and colour.The YOLO algorithm, once taught, can recognise objects in real time. It operates by splitting an image into a grid of cells as input. The method predicts the presence of an item in each cell.

Problem Identification

Some problem identifications for YOLO object detection are –

1.Small Object Detection - YOLO can struggle to detect small objects, especially when they are close together or in cluttered environments and this is because the algorithm divides the image into a fixed number of grid cells, and if an object is smaller than a cell, it can be missed entirely.

2.Occlusion - Objects may not be detected by YOLO or may be mistakenly identified as another object when they are partially or completely obscured. Utilising object tracking and context data is one strategy for solving this issue.

3.Speed vs Accuracy Trade-Of - YOLO is known for its real-time performance, however this frequently comes at a cost of accuracy. When using YOLO, finding the right balance between speed and accuracy is essential. Depending on the use case, it might be necessary to change the hyperparameters or use a different model.

4.Generalisation - Variations in the environment or objects that are different from those in the training data may have an impact on YOLO's performance. In real-world circumstances where the objects of interest may differ greatly, this might be a substantial difficulty.


Algorithms discussed

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm is a neural network-based algorithm that performs object detection by dividing the input image into a grid of cells and predicting the bounding box and class probabilities for each cell.This is best algorithm for yolo object detection system. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the YOLO algorithm works:

1.Preprocessing: The input image is preprocessed by resizing it to a fixed size and normalising the pixel values.

2.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The preprocessed image is passed through a (CNN) to extract feature maps.

3.Object detection: The feature maps are then fed into a set of detection layers, which predict the class probabilities and bounding box coordinates for each cell in the feature map.

4.Non-maximum Suppression (NMS): The predicted bounding boxes are then filtered using (NMS) to remove overlapping detections.

5.Output: The final output of the YOLO algorithm is a set of bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.

Result and Discussion

A box will appear where the video from the webcam is shown.In that video, the program will identify the objects in the video.The objects will be surrounded by a rectangle boundary with the percentage of what the program thinks that object is. And press “q” key to stop the program.
